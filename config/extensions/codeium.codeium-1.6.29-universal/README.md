Currently, Codeium provides autocomplete, chat, and search capabilities in 70+ languages, with lightning fast speeds and state-of-the-art suggestion quality.

## Your New Autocomplete Superpowers

### Use Natural Language

Need to make changes in an unfamiliar language or codebase? Instead of spending hours learning all of the syntactical and stylistic details, type out comments in natural language and let Codeium get the job done.

### Minimize Boilerplate Coding

Sometimes feel like a code monkey copy-pasting and modifying boilerplate code over and over again? Let Codeium handle writing the repetitive work so that you can stay in the coding flow state, generating code faster than you can type.

### Find and Use APIs

Spend too much time searching for API endpoints for a task or their signatures to properly interact with them? Codeium has seen thousands of different API calls and can insert them properly to match your needs, without ever leaving the IDE.
